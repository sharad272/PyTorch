CNN is good with images and videoes rather than ANN.

CNN is a type of NN specifically designed to process and analyze such as (grid based data) images or videos.
They are particularly effective in tasks like image classification, image recognition & object detection.


Architecture of CNn:
Step 1- Feature Extraction using 2 operations
     a) Convolution layer --> Convolutional operations as we want to extract                                 low-level features such as edges.
     
     b) Pooling layer   --> Reduction of image or tensor size.

We flattens the tensor then proceed to Step 2

Step 2- Classification using ANN.



Convolution layers --> Pooling layers --> Flattens tensor (Conver it into 1 dimension) --> ANN --> Output layer

Image (1,28,28)
where 1 --> represents grayscale.
28*28 is image size

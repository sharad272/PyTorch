Supervised Learning --> Model will get trained on the Labelled Data

Regression (Predicting values)
Classification (Prediction Classes)

Regression

Linear Regression: Statistical model to predict the relationship between variables. Let's say X & Y where X is an independent variable and Y is dependent variable. Falls under Regression model
y=mx+c

Variables are continuous here (numeric)

Ex: Prediction


Logistic Regression: Here variables are categorical (0 or 1) Falls under classification model.
Ex: Email is spam or not
Ex: Given fruit is an apple or not. 

It gives you values between 0 and 1 only.


KNNs: K-nearest neighbor: Falls under classification 

Euclidian's distance (Straight Line distance) = Distance between 2 points (P & Q) --> sqrt((p2-p1)^2 - (q2-q1)^2)

Shorter the Euclidian's distance the better would be the result.



Naive Bayes Classification: 
Based on Bayes' theorem (Probability)
 



Decision trees (Classification & Regression both but mainly Classification)
(Nodes and Vertexes)
